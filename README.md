# Plotting Closing Prices using Pandas and Alpha Vantage
A project utilizing Alpha Vantage stock API and the Pandas library to plot hourly closing stock prices in an HTML page. 

Running the cells in Jupyter notebook will generate a CSV of stock data, as well as an [HTML page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mikepando/Alpha-Vantage-Pandas/blob/master/Project_files/av_project.html) where plots of the closing prices are plotted hourly. This project was a test of Pandas using stock data from the Alpha vantage API. The HTML page is pretty basic, but it just meant to be a simple representation of our data. All files are generated where the .ipynb file is located. 

### Prerequisites
The only requirements needed to run this project file are:
```
Jupyter Notebook
```
